DESCRIPTION

       phrases of meaning.

       Most modern Chinese people can communicate using this protocol.
ARGUMENTS         top

       The arguments are ordinal with the following 3 rules:
                     1. [subject] then [verb] then [object]
                     2. adverbial phrases before the [verb]
                     2. [time] before other adverbial phases

       subject       Just like English, subjects come at the start.
       
       time          Time expressions come immediately after the subject.
                     (the protocol allows for time before the subject)
       
       place         To explain where an event happened,
                     the place expression comes before the verb.
       
       preposition   These are phrases which qualify an activity.
                     They are placed before the verb and after the place.
       
       object        the Mandarin Chinese object has a great deal of flexibility.
                     It is usually placed after the verb,
                     but other possibilities include before the verb,
                     before the subject, or even omitted.
