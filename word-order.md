ARGUMENTS

       time          time expressions come immediately after the subject
                     (the protocol allows for time before the subject)

       adverbial phrases, eg:

              place         to explain where an event happened,
                            the place expression comes before the verb

              preposition   these are phrases which qualify an activity. they
                            are placed before the verb, after the place

       verb          the verb comes immediately before the object

       object        the Mandarin object has a great deal of flexibility.
                     it is usually placed after the verb, but other
                     possibilities include before the verb, before the
                     subject, sometimes omitted.

              2. adverbial phrases before the [verb]
              2. [time] before other adverbial phases
