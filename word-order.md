DESCRIPTION

       The mandarin protocol allows the users to communicate using short phrases

ARGUMENTS

       subject       Just like English, subjects come at the start

       time          Time expressions come immediately after the subject
                     (the protocol allows for time before the subject)

       adverbial phrases, eg:

              place         To explain where an event happened,
                            the place expression comes before the verb

              preposition   These are phrases which qualify an activity. They
                            are placed before the verb and after the place
       
       verb          the verb comes immediately before the object

       object        the Mandarin object has a great deal of flexibility.
                     It is usually placed after the verb, but other
                     possibilities include before the verb, before the
                     subject, or even omitted.

              2. [time] before other adverbial phases
